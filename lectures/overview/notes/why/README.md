# [Why JavaScript?](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/754/16712/124457)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify JavaScript's key features
- Analyze JavaScript's role as the most used web development programming language
- Describe the web's three core technologies

## Why JS?

>The “Language of the Web” title is not an empty, boastful tagline. JavaScript truly is the most widely used programming language in the world. When you code in JS, you code in a language more web developers can understand than any other language!

## The Big Three

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## JavaScript Features

### interpreted

  - V8
  - SpiderMonkey

### event-driven
 
>This means that the flow of the program is determined by the user's actions.


### single-threaded

>JavaScript runs one command at a time, never performing operations concurrently. You will often hear the phrase synchronous to describe this process of running code line-by-line.

  - [event loop](): 

>a specialized queue that allows JavaScript to dynamically add new operations when the events happen, even if it is already performing operations.
