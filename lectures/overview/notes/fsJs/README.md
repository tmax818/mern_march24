- Describe the MERN technology stack and its components

## Full Stack JavaScript

### Front and Back End

>Ultimately, the front end can be boiled down to the presentation shown to the user, while the back end handles data processing, data persistence, and other server-side processes. Learning both makes you a front-end developer and a back-end developer. This combination of skills affords the distinction of being called a full-stack developer.


## Client-Server Architecture

- a __client__ is a machine that requests data through the internet

- __Server__ is a machine that contain all of the data and resources needed to display content.
