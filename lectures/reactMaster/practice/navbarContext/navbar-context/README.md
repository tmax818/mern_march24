# [Navbar Context (Practice)](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/754/16735/124700)

## Learning Objectives

- Implement context concepts to share data amongst components.

### You will need to create the following components:

- [App.jsx](./src/App.jsx): This component should wrap the Navbar and the FormWrapper components (and will access useState).
- [Form.jsx](./src/components/Form.jsx): This component should actually hold the input field.
- [FormWrapper.jsx](./src/components/FormWrapper.jsx): This component should only wrap the Form Component as its child. This is to illustrate that you can use nested components with context without passing down props.
- [Navbar.jsx](./src/components/Navbar.jsx): This component should be your navbar which contains the greeting.
You will also need to create the [context object].
