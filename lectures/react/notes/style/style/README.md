## Learning Objectives

- Contrast different approaches for adding styles to a React app


## Styling in the App.css



## Our Base Method

>Throughout the course, we will mostly utilize this approach for ease of implementation when styling technique is not the primary topic of concern. With that in mind, we can achieve the same goal by using the default App.css file in our src folder. To reset the default CSS, be sure to delete the boilerplate styling in the App.css as well as the index.css.

## Direct Import

## A Deeper Dive: CSS Modules
