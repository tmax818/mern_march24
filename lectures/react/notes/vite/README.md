## Learning Objectives

- Implement the necessary commands to set up a Vite-scaffolded React application and ensure the project dependencies are installed
- Examine and explain the folder structure of a Vite-scaffolded React application, including the role of key files and folders
- Describe the relationship between App.jsx, Main.jsx, and index.html in a Vite-scaffolded React application and their roles in rendering the application

## Vite in the Terminal

```bash
$ npm create vite@latest
```

- [package.json](./first-vite/package.json) a requirements guide for your application.
- [index.html](./first-vite/index.html) entry point to the browser and the DOM


## App.jsx - main.jsx - index.html

- [App.jsx](./first-vite/src/App.jsx)
- [Main.jsx](./first-vite/src/main.jsx)
- [index.html](./first-vite/index.html) entry point to the browser and the DOM
