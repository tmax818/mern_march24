## Learning Objectives

- Differentiate between parameters and props in ordinary functions and React functional components to pass and receive data
- Pass props data from parent to child components using JSX attributes and utilize destructuring to access and display the props data

## Building for Reusability

## What is a [Prop]?

>When React components are created, they are automatically passed an empty JavaScript object, similar in structure to the JavaScript object literals we have worked with thus far, {}. This object is referred to as [props], which is short for properties.
