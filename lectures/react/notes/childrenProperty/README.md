## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of children in React components and how they are defined between the opening and closing JSX tags.
- Explain how children elements/components are accessed within a component through the props object.

## A Component's Children

>Components may contain __children__, which refer to the elements or components that are enclosed between the opening and closing tags of JSX elements. In React, we can utilize props' children property to access the children of a component.
