# [Lifting State](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/754/16723/124609)

## Learning Objectives

- Define the concept of state lifting and its purpose in React.
- Identify scenarios where state lifting is necessary to share data between parent and child components.

## Lifting State in React Components

>What if we need to share that data between multiple components? We know data flows downward in React from parent to child components. If state is established in a child component, then that state cannot be assessed by its parent component or the parent component's other children.

>To make state data accessible to multiple components, we must establish a data flow where state is initialized in the parent component and passed down to whichever children components need access to the state data. This flow is referred to as "__lifting state__."
