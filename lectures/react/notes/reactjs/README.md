## React

## A Library, At Heart

## Customization is Key


## Performance through Architecture


## Components, Props, and State

__Components__ 
- React's core building blocks 
- encapsulates specific functionalities of the UI 
- multiple components used together form complex React user interfaces

__props__
- input for components
- a hybrid of a standard function's __parameters__ and an HTML element's __attributes__ that allow data to be passed into a component.

__state__
- a components internal __data__
- __Updating the value of a component's state triggers the component to rerender, which updates the DOM and UI.__

## Monitoring with the Virtual DOM

__Virtual DOM__
- a lightweight copy of the browser's DOM.
- __diffing__
