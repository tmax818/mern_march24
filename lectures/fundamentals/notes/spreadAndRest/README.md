## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate the use of the spread operator to make a copy that references the same memory location as the original in a JavaScript object or array
- Distinguish between shallow and deep copies in terms of their impact on the original object or array
- Utilize the rest pattern in JavaScript destructuring to extract and assign the remaining array elements using the rest operator

## The Spread and Rest Operator

### Copies with Spread

### Shallow vs. Deep Copies

> a shallow copy means the newly created copy references the same place in memory as the original.

> Using the spread operator, we can create a deep copy of our original object.
