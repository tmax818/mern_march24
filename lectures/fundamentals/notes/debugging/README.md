# [Debugging JavaScript](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/754/16713/124465)

## Learning Objectives

- Define __syntax__ and __runtime errors__.
- Describe the role `console.logs` play in debugging JavaScript.

##

>JavaScript runs in two parts.

1. compilation/parsing
1. execution (interpretation)

__syntax Errors__ happen when the parser finds invalid JavaScript.

__runtime error__ is what happens if your code successfully parses and the error happens while the program is running.
