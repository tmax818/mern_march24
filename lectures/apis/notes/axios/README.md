## Learning Objectives

- Installing Axios into a React Application
- Explore the syntax of Axios *over* using .fetch()
- Learn when to use Axios over using native JavaScript commands like fetch.

## Axios

>`.fetch()` is a great tool for whenever we need to make an HTTP request to an API using just JavaScript. However in larger more complex applications we can bring in a library to streamline the behavior of `.fetch()`.
