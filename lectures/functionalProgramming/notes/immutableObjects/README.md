# [Immutable Objects](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/754/16714/124476)

## Learning Objectives

- Apply the concept of immutability in data manipulation
- Demonstrate proficiency in using array methods like `.concat()`, `.slice()`, and `.sort()` to perform operations on arrays
- Analyze and interpret the behavior of JavaScript array methods in relation to immutability and data manipulation

## Immutable Data

>Soon in React, we will have to deal with manipulating data that is immutable, meaning we can not change it. Instead of attempting to change data we can not change, our strategy will be to copy the data with the new changes we want applied, and then save that copy over the original. We can't practice how React will treat data exactly yet, but we can mimic the behavior our data will have. Using `Object.freeze()` we can force our data to be immutable to practice the skills we'll need for React.
