## Lifting State


>What if we need to share that data between multiple components? We know data flows downward in React from parent to child components. If state is established in a child component, then that state cannot be assessed by its parent component or the parent component's other children.


>To make state data accessible to multiple components, we must establish a data flow where state is initialized in the parent component and passed down to whichever children components need access to the state data. This flow is referred to as "__lifting state__."
